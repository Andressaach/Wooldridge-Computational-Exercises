This repository contains my solutions to the computational exercises proposed in Jeffrey M. Wooldridgeâ€™s textbook, "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach".
The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of econometric theory and its practical implementation using Python and other analytical tools.

ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Strengthen my econometrics foundation through hands-on problem solving
- Apply statistical and econometric methods using real or simulated data
- Practice model estimation, diagnostic testing, and interpretation of coefficients
